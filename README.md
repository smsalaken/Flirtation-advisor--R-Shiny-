A R+Shiny application to help you decide if someone is flirting with you

We will all agree, probably, that flirting with someone is a very fuzzy thing. The boundary between flirt and
friendly behavior is extremely blurred. We often need a third opinion to decide if someone else is flirting with us, or
was that just a friendly behavior. Mostly we depend on friends for a second or third opinion, and may have ended up with
some degree of embarassment in many cases.

Due to its nature, flirting is a very good problem to tackle with fuzzy logic system. The application I have built is based 
on an academic research conducted in University of Sourthern California, USA. Based on two top indicators of flirt (touching 
and  eye contact), the system will tell you what most people will think about the behavior of the person in question. 
This will be mostly true for North American setting, but still can be different based on race, culture and a number of other
factors. All you need to do is to select the amount of touch and the amount of eye contact you think the other person is 
making with you. 

This might save you from a future embarassment. More reading about the methods used in this application is linked in the 
app demonstration.
